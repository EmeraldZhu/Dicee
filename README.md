# Dicee - Simple "Roll the Dice" game

Every time you reload the page, the values on two dice change randomly. 
The game then compares the values and declares a winner based on which die has the higher number. 
In case of a tie, it announces a draw.

A fun project to explore and understand the Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation in JavaScript.
